            A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer or other electronic device that connects and allows communication between all other components and peripherals. It acts as the central backbone of a computer, ensuring that the CPU, RAM, storage, and other hardware components work together effectively. The motherboard is essential for the overall performance, upgradeability, and functionality of a computer. It determines the types of components you can use, such as the CPU, RAM, and storage devices, and influences the system's capabilities and lifespan.

            <li>ATX: Standard size for desktop computers, offering multiple expansion slots.</li>
            <li>MicroATX (mATX): Smaller than ATX, with fewer expansion slots but still versatile.</li>
            <li>Mini-ITX: Compact form factor for small and portable PCs.</li>
            <li>Server Motherboards: Designed for servers, often supporting multiple CPUs and large amounts of RAM.</li>

            Socket compatibility refers to the compatibility between a CPU (Central Processing Unit) and the socket on a motherboard. Each CPU fits into a specific type of socket, and the motherboard must have the correct socket to support that CPU.

            Chipset compatibility refers to the compatibility between a CPU and the chipset on a motherboard. The chipset plays a crucial role in determining which features and technologies the motherboard can support, and it works in conjunction with the CPU to manage data flow between the processor, memory, storage devices, and peripherals.
